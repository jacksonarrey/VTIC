        <h4 style="color: #106bff;">3 Months Program </h4>
            <p>
                The 3-month Event Planning program will begin with an exploration of the Fundamentals of Event
                Planning, where participants will learn essential concepts, terminology, and best practices for
                 organizing successful events through engaging lectures and interactive discussions. In the second
                  month, the focus will shift to Budgeting and Financial Management, equipping students with the 
                  skills to create and manage event budgets, understand funding sources, and analyze financial
                   reports through practical exercises and case studies. The program will then cover Marketing 
                   Events, emphasizing strategies for promoting events effectively, leveraging social media, and 
                   engaging target audiences through hands-on workshops and project work. Finally, participants will
                   
                   learn about Basic Logistics and Operations, covering key aspects such as venue selection, vendor
                    management, and on-site coordination, with real-world scenarios to apply their learning. This 
                    comprehensive approach combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications, preparing
                     participants for successful careers in event planning and management.

                <h4 style="color: #106bff;"> 6-Month Program: </h4>
                <P> The 6-month Event Planning program will provide an in-depth understanding of advanced concepts and
                     practices in the field. It will begin with Advanced Event Planning, where participants will explore 
                     complex event scenarios, including large-scale and multi-day events, through case studies and 
                     collaborative planning exercises. In the second month, the focus will shift to Risk Management, 
                     teaching students to identify potential risks, develop mitigation strategies, and create contingency
                      plans to ensure successful event execution. The third month will cover Event Design and Experience, 
                      emphasizing the importance of creating engaging and memorable experiences for attendees, with hands-on 
                      workshops in creative design and audience engagement techniques. In the fourth month, the program will 
                      explore Technology in Event Management, where participants will learn about the latest tools and
                       platforms for event planning, registration, and engagement, including virtual and hybrid event 
                       technologies. Finally, the last two months will culminate in a comprehensive project where students
                        apply their knowledge to design and plan a complete event, integrating all aspects learned throughout
                         the program. This immersive approach 
                    prepares participants to excel in the dynamic field of event management.

                <h4 style="color: #106bff;"> 1-Year Program: </h4>
                <P>The 1-year Event Management program offers a thorough education in the field, starting with Comprehensive
                     Event Management, where participants will gain a deep understanding of the event planning process, 
                     including conceptualization, execution, and evaluation, through a blend of lectures, workshops, and 
                     real-world case studies. The second component focuses on Specialized Event Types, allowing students 
                     to explore the unique challenges and strategies associated with various events, such as corporate 
                     gatherings, weddings, and festivals, through targeted projects and guest speaker insights. 
                     The program will also address Leadership and Team Management, equipping participants with essential
                      skills to lead diverse teams, manage stakeholder relationships, and navigate the complexities of event
                       logistics through interactive group activities and leadership exercises. Finally, the program culminates
                        in a Capstone Project, where students will apply their learning to plan and execute a comprehensive 
                        event, demonstrating their mastery of all aspects of event management. This structured approach ensures
                         graduates are well-prepared for successful careers in the dynamic and evolving field of event
