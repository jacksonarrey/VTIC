        <h4 style="color: #106bff;">3 Months Program </h4>
            <p>The 3-month Business Management program will begin with an Introduction to Coaching
                 Principles, where participants will learn the foundational concepts of coaching, including
                  its importance in leadership and team development, through engaging lectures and interactive
                   discussions. In the second month, the focus will shift to Effective Communication Skills, 
                   emphasizing the significance of clear and impactful communication in a business context,
                    with activities such as role-playing and group exercises to practice active listening and 
                    feedback techniques. The program will then cover Goal Setting and Achievement, teaching
                     participants how to set SMART goals and develop actionable plans to achieve them, reinforced
                      by workshops that encourage personal reflection and peer accountability. Finally, the program 
                      will introduce Basic Coaching Techniques, where participants will practice essential coaching 
                      skills such as questioning, active listening, and providing constructive feedback through hands-on
                       exercises and mock coaching sessions. This structured approach blends theoretical knowledge with
                        practical applications,
                 equipping participants with essential skills for effective business management and leadership</p>
        

                <h4 style="color: #106bff;"> 6-Month Program: </h4>
                <P> The 6-month Business Management program offers an in-depth 
                    exploration of advanced coaching and management concepts. It begins with a focus on Advanced Coaching 
                    Techniques, where participants enhance their skills through interactive workshops and peer coaching 
                    sessions. The second month emphasizes Business Strategy Development, teaching strategic planning 
                    frameworks and collaborative project work to create effective business strategies. In the third month,
                     students learn about Performance Measurement, including key performance indicators (KPIs) and evaluation
                      methods, through practical exercises. The fourth month centers on Client Relationship Management, 
                      focusing on techniques for building strong client relationships and resolving conflicts, supported by

                       comprehensive project that combines coaching, strategy, and performance measurement. Finally, the 
                       program culminates in a Capstone Project and Review, where students present their strategic plans or
                        coaching models, receiving feedback and ensuring they leave with 
                    practical skills for effective leadership and coaching in diverse business environments.
